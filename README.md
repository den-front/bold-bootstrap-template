BOLD is a **Bootstrap** template that includes all the necessary blocks for a startup site, SaaS product site, blog, and more. It is fully responsive, fast, and smooth, built with **Pug.js** and **Sass** technology, and bundled with **Parcel** bundler.

This is my pet project for practice, and I have made sure to create clean and reusable components that can be easily customized to fit any project's needs.
